I woke up at 3 am. 
I ate Mini Wheats for breakfast. 
I started my fast at 4 pm. 
2 hours later, at 6 am, I went to school. 
I didn't eat lunch at school because I'm fasting. 
I went home after school. 
I played CS:GO for 3 hours with my friends. 
I broke my fast by eating rice and chicken at 8:21 pm.
I go to sleep.
